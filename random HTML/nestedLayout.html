    <br> inside h1 there is only a video thumbnail-1
    <br> inside h2 there will be 2 vertical nests,let us call it as h2v1 and h2v2
    <br> inside h2v1 there will be only a thumbnail image of video-author
    <br> inside h2v2 there will be another 3 horizontal nest that will contains:
    <br> 1. video - title
    <br> 2. Video - author
